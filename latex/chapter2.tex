\chapter{Stock returns over the FOMC Cycle Revisited }


\section{The FOMC cycle}

The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meets approximately every eight weeks during the year,  resulting in an FOMC cycle time of approximately 7 weeks (excluding weekends) most of the time since a year has 52 weeks. The authors, therefore, define FOMC cycle time week dummy variables for week 0 as days -1 to 3, week 1 as days 4 to 8, and week 6 as days 29 to 33. Worth mentioning is that the authors drop 3 days, which would be in FOMC cycle week 7 from their investigation, and that the number of available data points decreases for FOMC dummies (meaning 920 days in week 0,  924 days in week 2,  831 days in week 4,  120 days in week 6 for the relevant timespan from 1994 to 2016).

\section{Measurement and estimation analysis (MEA)}

\subsection{MLR model}

One relevant multiple linear regression (MLR) model with dummy variables for even FOMC cycle weeks as in \parencite{cieslak_stock_2019} can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
	rxpct_{i}=\hat{\beta_{0}}+D_0*\hat{\gamma_{1}}+D_1*\hat{\gamma_{2}}+\epsilon_i
\end{equation}
where
$ { \hat{\beta_{0}} } $ is the OLS-estimated intercept,
$ { \hat{\gamma_{1}}, \hat{\gamma_{2}} } $ the OLS-estimated parameters,
${ rx_{i} } $ the excess returns as calculated like in chapter 3.3.4., 
\begin{equation}
    D_0=
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if in the 0 week within FOMC cycle time. }\\
      0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
the FOMC cycle dummy for week 0, 
\begin{equation}
    D_1=
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if in the 2,4 or 6 week within FOMC cycle time. } \\
      0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
the FOMC cycle dummy for week 2, 4, 6 and
$ { \epsilon_i \; \sim \; i.i.d.  \; \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2 \right) } $
are independent identically distributed OLS-estimated standard errors. 

\subsection{FOMC dummies}

The R Code in \texttt{generate\_fomc\_dummies\_cycle\_dummies.R} (see R Code Appendix)
generates FOMC week dummy variables for later estimation of the influence on FOMC meeting dates on excess stock returns.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

The analysis commences with the importation and organization of two distinct datasets. 
The first dataset, identified as \texttt{fomc\_data}, is loaded from the file \texttt{fomc\_week\_dummies\_1994\_nov2023.csv}. 
This dataset encompasses information related to FOMC week dummies spanning from November 1994 to November 2023. The data is sorted by date, and the sorted dataset is then saved as \texttt{d:fomc\_data}, thereby replacing any pre-existing file.

Following this, the second dataset, labeled as \texttt{us\_returns\_data}, is imported from the file \texttt{us\_returns\_df\_1994\_oct2023.csv}. This dataset contains information regarding Fama-French factors for the U.S. market, covering the period from October 1994 to October 2023. Similar to the first dataset, it undergoes sorting by date, and the sorted dataset is saved as \texttt{d:us\_returns\_data}, replacing any existing file.

To consolidate the information, a merge operation is executed using the "date" variable as the key. This operation combines the \texttt{fomc\_data} and \texttt{us\_returns\_data} datasets into a new dataset named \texttt{fed\_put\_datamerged\_data}. The merged dataset is saved as \texttt{d:fed\_put\_datamerged\_data}, effectively replacing any prior file.

Finally, a new variable named \texttt{date2} is generated by transforming the existing "date" variable into Stata date format. This conversion is carried out using the \texttt{date()} function with the "YMD" (year-month-day) format. The resulting dataset is now prepared for further analysis, incorporating information from both the FOMC week dummies and U.S. market returns datasets.

\subsection{Calculation of stock excess returns}

Excess stock returns are calculated using the Fama-French 3-factor model developed by Kenneth R. French and Eugene Fama.  
Data for US market returns for this model and also for various other markets (e.g., European, Asia) get published regularly on Kenneth R. French's webpage. \parencite{kenneth_r_kenneth_nodate}

If \(m\) represents \(1 + \text{{stock return}}\) and \(r\) denote \(1 + \text{{bill return}}\), the 1-day excess return (\text{{ex1}}) is calculated by subtracting \(r\) from \(m\) and multiplying the result by 100, which can be expressed as \(\text{{ex1}} = 100 \times (m - r)\). The 5-day excess return (\text{{ex5}}) is computed over a rolling 5-day window, involving the product of five consecutive values of \(m\) and \(r\). The formula is given by \(\text{{ex5}} = 100 \times (m \times m_{t+1} \times m_{t+2} \times m_{t+3} \times m_{t+4} - r \times r_{t+1} \times r_{t+2} \times r_{t+3} \times r_{t+4})\).

Furthermore, \(t\) represents the observation number in the dataset. 
Overall, the calculation for evaluating stock excess returns provides insight into their 
performance relative to the risk-free rate.

% Answer Q.: Does the stylized fact of stock excess returns are mainly achieved in FOMC even weeks (0,  2,  4,  6) from 2016 onwards still persist?

In the first sample from 2016 onwards (2016-2019), where the coefficient for the term for FOMC cycle week 0 is statistically significant on the 5\%-level, the sign of the coefficient turned negative, which has been labeled by the media as a "Fed Call." \parencite{noauthor_fed_nodate}

Looking at the whole period from 1994 to 2023, the regression coefficient of the FOMC cycle pattern turns out to be significantly smaller.

All samples from COVID-19 onwards seem to be statistically insignificant so far, suggesting that the FOMC cycle pattern has probably decreased or vanished.
