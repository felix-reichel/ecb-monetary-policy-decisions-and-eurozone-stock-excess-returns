\chapter{Motivation}

The starting point of this thesis is recently conducted research which studies the link and causal effects between monetary policy decisions by the FED and stock market in the U.S.  not only in an ex-post,  but moreover in an ex-ante sense.

The paper "Stock Returns over the FOMC Cycle" \parencite{cieslak_stock_2019} finds that "the equity premium is entirely earned in even weeks starting from the last FOMC meeting (0,  2,  4 and 6)" which implies that the FED has "overly affected the stock market via unexpectatly accommodating policy". 

Another paper "The Economics of the FED Put"  \parencite{cieslak_economics_2021} uses textual analysis of FOMC scripts to identify and measure the causal effect that policy makers indeed pay intention to the "stock market" and negative stock returns are linked with downgrades in growth projections (in an ex-post sense) since the mid-1990s.  
Although policy makers seem to be aware of that the so-called "FED put" "could induce risk-taking" the paper concludes that it does not "significantly affect their decision-making in an ex-ante sense".

In my thesis I aim to find out whether the "FED Put" remains relevant in the Eurozone from 2016 onwards till 2023 (complicated by the COVID-19 crisis) and whether a similar dynamic can be observed within the European Central Bank's policy, particularly concerning interest rates and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) containing European stocks.
