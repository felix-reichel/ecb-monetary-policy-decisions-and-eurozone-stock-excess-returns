\chapter{Motivation}

The starting point of this thesis is recently conducted research that studies the link and possible causal effects between monetary policy decisions by the FED and the stock market in the U.S., not only in an ex-post but also in an ex-ante sense.

The paper Stock Returns over the FOMC Cycle \parencite{cieslak_stock_2019} finds a pattern in financial markets around the world that suggests that stock market excess returns in the last 23 were entirely earned in even weeks (0, 2, 4 and 6) starting from the last FOMC meeting. The authors tie their findings to a known phenomenon called "Fed Put", by which they mean accommodating monetary policy.

In a follow-up paper, The Economics of the FED Put \parencite{cieslak_economics_2021} the authors use textual analysis of FOMC (Federal Open Market Commitee) scripts to identify and measure the causal effect that policymakers indeed pay intention to the stock market, especially since the mid-1990s and stock market performance is linked with the FEDâ€™s internal growth projections. The authors further claim that even if the policymakers seem to be aware that a dynamic like the FED put could induce risk-taking behavior leading to moral-hazard implications, it does not particularly affect their decision-making in an ex-ante sense.

In my thesis, I aim to find out whether the financial pattern regarding stock excess returns in FOMC even weeks is still relevant from 2016 (which should not be the case, especially once the information has reached the market) onwards (probably complicated by the COVID-19 crisis) since the paper published in 2019 only investigates this pattern before 2016. Additionally, the authors prove the relevance of their financial pattern worldwide using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing European stocks. I want to include further results with a specific focus on European stock returns.

%In my thesis I aim to find out whether the "FED Put" remains relevant in the %Eurozone from 2016 onwards till 2023  and whether a similar dynamic can %be observed within the European Central Bank's policy, particularly concerning interest rates and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) containing %European stocks.

\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the examination of stock excess returns during Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) even weeks (0, 2, 4, 6) from 2016 onwards has revealed intriguing patterns, particularly when comparing US and European stock markets. The coefficients for dummy variables in Table \ref{table:dummy_comparison} underscore the distinct responses of the two markets during the FOMC cycle. Notably, in the 2016-2019 period, US stocks exhibited a negative "Fed Call" with a coefficient of -0.211** in FOMC week 0, while European stocks showed a less pronounced negative response with a coefficient of -0.106. Similarly, during FOMC week 2, 4, 6, US stocks displayed a coefficient of -0.0487, contrasting with the positive coefficient of 0.00678 for European stocks.

Examining the entire 1994-2023 period reveals a significantly smaller regression coefficient for the FOMC cycle pattern, suggesting potential shifts in market dynamics over the long term. Notably, samples from the COVID-19 era onwards exhibit statistical insignificance, hinting at a potential decrease or disappearance of the FOMC cycle pattern.
