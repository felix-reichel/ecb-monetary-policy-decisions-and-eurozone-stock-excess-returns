\chapter{Motivation}

The starting point of this thesis is recently conducted research that studies the link and possible causal effects between monetary policy decisions by the FED and the stock market in the U.S., not only in an ex-post but also in an ex-ante sense.

The paper "Stock Returns over the FOMC Cycle" \parencite{cieslak_stock_2019} finds a pattern in financial markets around the world that suggests that stock market excess returns in the last 23 were entirely earned in even weeks (0, 2, 4 and 6) starting from the last FOMC meeting. The authors tie their findings to a known phenomenon called "Fed Put", by which they mean accommodating monetary policy.

In a follow-up paper, "The Economics of the FED Put" \parencite{cieslak_economics_2021} the authors use textual analysis of FOMC (Federal Open Market Commitee) scripts to identify and measure the causal effect that policymakers indeed pay intention to the stock market, especially since the mid-1990s and stock market performance is linked with updates of the FEDâ€™s internal growth projections.  The authors further claim that even if the policymakers seem to be aware that a dynamic like the FED put could cause overly risky investing behavior leading to moral-hazard implications,  it does not particularly change their decision-making in an ex-ante sense.

In my thesis,  I aim to find out whether the financial pattern regarding stock excess returns in FOMC even weeks is still relevant from 2016 (which should not be the case, especially once the information has reached the market) onwards (probably complicated by the COVID-19 crisis) since the paper published in 2019 only investigates this pattern before 2016. Additionally, the authors prove the relevance of their financial pattern worldwide using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing European stocks. I want to include further results with a specific focus on European stock returns.

%In my thesis I aim to find out whether the "FED Put" remains relevant in the %Eurozone from 2016 onwards till 2023  and whether a similar dynamic can %be observed within the European Central Bank's policy, particularly concerning interest rates and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) containing %European stocks.

\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the examination of stock excess returns during Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) even weeks (0, 2, 4, 6) from 2016 onwards shows distinct patterns, also when comparing US and European stock markets. The comparison of coefficients for dummy variables in Table \ref{table:table_5} display the slight differences in the responses of the two markets during the FOMC cycle.  

In the pre-covid period (2016-2019),  US stocks exhibited a negative "Fed Call" with a coefficient of -0.211, statistically significant at the 5\%-level in FOMC week 0, while European stocks showed a less pronounced negative response with a statistically insignificant (indifferent from 0 for all significance-levels) coefficient of -0.106. Similarly, during FOMC week 2, 4, 6, US stocks displayed a coefficient of -0.0487 (statistically insignificant),  contrasting with the positive coefficient of 0.00678 (statistically insignificant) for European stocks. 

Focussing on the entire revisited sample period (1994-2023) results in statistically significantly smaller regression coefficients for the FOMC cycle pattern.  Overall, samples from the COVID-19 onwards exhibit statistical insignificance,  suggesting a potential decrease or disappearance of the FOMC cycle pattern.
