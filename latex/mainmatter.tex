\chapter{Motivation}

This thesis is motivated by recent research that delves into the potential causal relationship between the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve (FED) and the U.S. stock market.  Building upon existing studies, which primarily examine this connection retrospectively,  the focus extends to exploring both ex-post and ex-ante perspectives.

\cite{cieslak_stock_2019} (2019) finds a pattern in financial markets around the world that suggests that stock market excess returns in the last 23 were entirely earned in even weeks (0, 2, 4 and 6) starting from the last FOMC meeting. The authors tie their findings to a known phenomenon called "FED Put", by which they mean accommodating monetary policy.

\cite{cieslak_economics_2021} (2021) use textual analysis of FOMC (Federal Open Market Commitee) scripts to identify that policymakers indeed pay attention to the stock market, especially since the mid-1990s and stock market performance is linked with updates of the FEDâ€™s internal growth projections.  The authors further claim that even if the policymakers seem to be aware that a dynamic like the FED Put could cause overly risky investing behavior leading to moral-hazard implications,  it does not particularly change their decision-making in an ex-ante sense.

In my thesis, my goal is to explore whether the financial pattern concerning excess returns in FOMC even weeks remains pertinent after 2016 or from that year onward.  (probably complicated by the COVID-19 crisis) This is significant as one would anticipate a decrease in relevance, particularly after the market became aware of the pattern.  \cite{cieslak_stock_2019} (2019) exclusively examines this pattern before 2016. Furthermore, the authors assess the global significance of this financial pattern by examining exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing European stocks. I aim to incorporate additional findings, with a particular emphasis on the returns of European stock excess returns.

%In my thesis I aim to find out whether the "FED Put" remains relevant in the %Eurozone from 2016 onwards till 2023  and whether a similar dynamic can %be observed within the European Central Bank's policy, particularly concerning interest rates and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) containing %European stocks.

\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the examination of stock excess returns during Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) even weeks (0, 2, 4, 6) from 2016 onwards show patterns that are distinct from previous sample periods, also when comparing US and European stock markets. The comparison on the coefficients on the dummy variables in Table \ref{table:table_5} display the differences in the responses of the two markets during the FOMC cycle.  

In the period before COVID-19 (2016-2019),  US stocks exhibited a negative "FED Call" with a coefficient of -0.211, statistically significant at the 5\%-level in FOMC week 0, while European stocks showed a less pronounced negative response with a statistically insignificant (indifferent from 0 for all significance-levels) coefficient of -0.106. Similarly, during FOMC week 2, 4, 6, US stocks display a statistically insignificant coefficient of -0.0487,  contrasting the statistically insignificant positive coefficient of 0.00678 for European stocks. 

Focussing on the entire revisited sample period (1994-2023) results in statistically significantly smaller regression coefficients for the FOMC cycle pattern.  Overall, samples from COVID-19 onwards exhibit a lack of statistical significance,  suggesting a potential decrease or disappearance of the FOMC cycle pattern.
